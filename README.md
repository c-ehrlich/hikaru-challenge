# Hikaru Challenge

## About
This app is two things:
1. An easy way to watch all Hikaru videos and keep track of where you are. It uses LocalStorage, so progress is saved between sessions.
2. It can easily be adjusted to track any other playlist of videos by using a different JSON file.

## What's the point?
YouTube playlist functionality utterly breaks when the playlist reaches above some very large number of videos.
A couple of [Immersion Language Learners](https://discord.gg/XuwYR4Wy6j) wanted to watch all 1500+ hours of the YouTuber "ヒカル", so the [Hikaru Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdsp3cMl_20) was born.
